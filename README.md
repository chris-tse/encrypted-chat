### CS 4173 Final Project
Christopher Tse, Charlie Liu, Zachary Connor

## Development

### Setting up the project

Clone the project to your computer by downloading the zip or using git. Install the required packages and run the server:  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chris-tse/totally-secure-chat
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Setting a login password

When developing locally, the password is set in the `npm start` script as an environment variable. Simply replace the `PW=password` place with your desired password as follows: `PW=<yourPassword>`. The hosted version on Heroku must be edited through the settings interface on the website.
